# 🐍 SerpentAI-SuperHexagon ⬡

Any suggestion / help you can provide to this project is appreciated.

## 🎉 Introduction
This project contains both the **Game Plugin** and the **Game Agent Plugin** needed for the **SerpentAI** library to function.

## ❓ Why
I got me a MPB for work, so no fancy TensorFlow GPU acceleration for me 😢.
So for now I will mainly gather captures and regions and region captures for anyone that wishes to train some models.
*If you do, please feel free to make a PR to this repository*.

## ⚡️ Getting started
Take a look at the main [SerpentAI Wiki](https://github.com/SerpentAI/SerpentAI/wiki) to learn how to use the library.
Once this is done, simply clone this repo and run `serpent` in it.

## ✏️ Contributions
I honestly don't know much about licenses or so anyone can suggest which one to adopt and such.
If you have a feature request you can't code yourself or an issue then go [here](https://github.com/kjullien/SerpentAI-SuperHexagon/issues).
I use the git flow model to dev so if you want to contribute simply follow the `feature/feature-name` branching strategy.
Also I like to use [emojis](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/) because why not its a cool visual aid to speed things along 👌.
